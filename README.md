# **Logistic Regression Classifier for Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**  

##  Overview  
This repository contains a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier implemented for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset using Scikit-Learn. The model is trained, validated, and tested using K-Fold Cross-Validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.  

##  Files 
- **`LR_Classifier_Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer.ipynb`** â€“ Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation, explanations, and results.  
- **`lr_classifier_wisconsin_breast_cancer.py`** â€“ Python script version for quick execution.  

## Dataset 
- The **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets` is used. You can also check the dataset from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic 
- It contains **569 samples** with **30 features** each.  
- **Target variable (`y`)**:  
  - `0` â†’ Malignant (cancerous)  
  - `1` â†’ Benign (non-cancerous)  

##  Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
2. **Train-Test Split (70-30 split)**  
3. **Model Training using Logistic Regression**  
4. **K-Fold Cross-Validation (5-fold)**  
5. **Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)**  
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV**
